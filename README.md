This repo is made to preserve Jim Coplien's seminal 2013 paper on unit testing upon which this blog was named, as the original site where the uploaded paper caused a storm on the internet among developers has expired. 

(If the Internet Archive that points to the copy ever goes down I will upload the PDFs here.)

First paper, "Why Most Unit Testing Is Waste"

Follow-up paper, "Segue":

Both papers contain invaluable insights for software developers. I include below some excerpts from the paper along with the criticisms, and you will notice that for all the dislike the papers have seen, no one has really objected to the papers' premise.

My takeaway: Unit Tests have business value almost exclusively when testing algorithmic logic, i.e. stateless functions that compute outputs from inputs. For everything else, integration tests provide a much greater ROI, and QA with "human in the loop" is indispensable.
